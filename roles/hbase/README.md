# Ansible HBase TDP

This is the main HBase directory. It includes the following sub-roles:

- HBase Master
- HBase RegionServer
- HBase REST
- HBase Client
- Phoenix Query Server
- Phoenix Client

Currently the roles only supports the deployment of SSL-enabled, Kerberos authenticated HBase clusters. HA is automatic when there is more than one HBase Master.
