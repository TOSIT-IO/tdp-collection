# Ansible Hive TDP

This is the main Hive directory. It includes the following sub-roles:

- HiveServer2
- Hive Client
- Tez

Currently the role only supports the deployment of SSL-enabled, Kerberos authenticated HiveServer2 instances. HA is automatic if there are more than one instances in the hosts file.

- Ranger TDP Hive plugin release .tar.gz (`ranger_hive_dist_file` role variable) file available in `files`
- Tez TDP release .tar.gz (`tez_dist_file` role variable) file available in `files`
- Groups `hive_s2` and `hive_client` defined in the Ansible inventory
- Role `hadoop_client` must have been previously executed on all `hive_s2` hosts
- Certificate files `{{ fqdn }}.key` and `{{ fqdn }}.pem` for every node available in `files`
- Certificate of the CA available as `root.pem` in `files`
- Admin access to a KDC with the `realm`, `kadmin_principal` and `kadmin_password` role vars provided
- A `krb5.conf` file with this KDC informations must be available at `files/krb5.conf`
