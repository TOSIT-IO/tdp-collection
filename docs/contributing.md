## How to contribute to TDP

* Before you open a ticket or send a pull request, [search](https://github.com/TOSIT-FR/ansible-tdp-roles/issues) for previous discussions about the same feature or issue. Add to the earlier ticket if you find one.

* Before sending a [pull request](https://github.com/TOSIT-FR/ansible-tdp-roles/pulls) for a feature, make sure to check your contribution with ansible-lint:

ansible-lint
```

* Use the same coding style as the rest of the code base. Check the [docs](https://github.com/TOSIT-FR/ansible-tdp-roles/tree/master/plugins) directory to review the latest code base style guide and code of conduct.
